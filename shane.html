				<h2>Shane Sea Bass Nightmare</h2>
					
						<article>
							<header><h3>Shane's Story</h3></header>
							<time datetime="2018-05-01">May 13, 2018</time>
							<p>Sane is an amateur Sea Bass angler for over 10 years. 
							   I don't have with any preferences about fly fishing.
							   As well as me Shane likes to fish for any type of fish species. 		   
							   Well every fly angler has a favorite. Shane's one is SEA BASS!</p>
							   
							<p>Fishing for Sea Bass could be very tricky most of the time, because of her
								food diet. Sea Bass is very fussy when comes to feeding. Every angler must
								understand the waters they fish and the bait species living around the
								waters. Also is essential to observe the waters for any small bait fish around. 
								Even understanding fully the species of fish and their behaving, sometimes
								the weather conditions will affect the Sea Bass fishing.</p>
								
							<p>But  fishing is not only about catching fish it is mostly about going away
							   of the busy stressing city life. It is about doing outdoor activities which you
							   can't do in the normal city life. We often go fishing with my friends Doncho and 
							   Angel and some times we do not catch any fish, but we are having great time 
								together walking around the fields, river banks and the sea beach. For me it is 
								electric, indescribable, fulfilled with magical views, small breeze and silence.
								These moments of quiet and relaxing time can contribute to gaining tranquility and peace.
								
							<p>My name is Shane and is Nice to meet you!!!
