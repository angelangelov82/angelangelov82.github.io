							<p>I am an amateur fly angler, and I am a member of D.T.A.A for about 5 years. 
							   I don't have any preferences about fly fishing.
							   I like to fly fish for any type of fish species. Well every fly angler
							   has a favorite. My one is trout!
							</p>
							   
							<p>Fishing for trout could be very tricky most of the time because of her
								food diet. Trout is very fussy when comes to feeding. Every angler must
								understand the waters they fish and the flies species living around the
								waters. Also is essential to observe the waters for any fly hatching of. 
								Even understanding fully the species of flies and their hatching, sometimes
								the weather conditions will affect the trout.
							</p>
								
							<p>But fly fishing is not only about catching fish it is mostly about going away
							   of the busy stressing city life. It is about doing outdoor activities which you
							   can't do in the normal city life. I often go fishing with my friends Doncho,George and 
							   Shane and some times we do not catch any fish, but we are having great time 
								together walking around the fields, river banks and the sea beach. For me it is 
								electric, indescribable, fulfilled with magical views, small breeze and silence.
								These moments of queit and relaxing time can contribute to gaining tranquility and peace!
